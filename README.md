# **Sentiment analysis of youtube comments**

## **Outline**

In this work, simple natural language processing (nlp) techniques are used to derive a model for sentiment analysis of youtube comments. A Kaggle dataset of youtube comments is used to train and validate the model. The dataset contains two columns, the comment text and the sentiment, classified as "positive", "negative" or "neutral". The neutral instances are removed from the analysis and only positive and negative sentiments are considered.
